# privacy shit (yes you should actually read this)

yo — i'll keep this simple. i hate privacy policies that are 47 pages of lawyer speak. here's the deal:

## what we take

- just your basic info (email, name) via firebase
- some usage stats so we know if the app is broken

## what we DON'T take

- your actual journal entries/notes
- any of your private thoughts
- literally anything personal

## how we handle your data

- your notes NEVER leave your device
- we built on hack club's custom linux servers (s/o to them for supporting teen builders with actual hardware)
- we're using llama-3.3-70b-versatile model running LOCALLY in the linux server

## why you can trust us

- completely open source — [check our code](https://github.com/Shrit1401/Daydream)
- we delete data aggressively
- built at [hack club](https://hackclub.com/) where privacy isn't just marketing
- we built this for ourselves first

questions? i'm literally [shrit1401@gmail.com](mailto:shrit1401@gmail.com) — email me and i'll actually respond.

ps: we're open source so if you don't believe me, check the repo and call me out
