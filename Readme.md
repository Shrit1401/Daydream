# ✨ What I’m Building

**Daydream** is an emotional reflection assistant. Users write journal entries about their daily thoughts, actions, or feelings — anything from  
_“I have to go to LA”_, _“I want to build a startup”_, to _“I don’t want to study anymore, but I have to.”_  
Daydream responds to each entry with a meaningful reflection, insight, or encouragement.

# 📝 How It Works

### 1. Daily Journal Input

Users log their daily thoughts, activities, or emotional states in a free-form journal.  
It’s unfiltered and in their own voice.

### 2. Intelligent Reflections

Daydream responds to each entry with thoughtful feedback — from emotional validation to subtle encouragement or even practical suggestions.

### 3. Emotion Journey Story (Every 5–10 Days)

After a series of entries, Daydream compiles an emotional journey.  
This story isn’t about reliving events — it’s about revealing patterns in your emotional evolution.

### 4. Emotion Analysis

Each entry is analyzed using AI for:

- **Core emotions** (joy, sadness, anxiety, hope, etc.)
- **Mood intensity**
- **Emotional trends over time**

These insights are woven into both the reflections and the final story.

### 5. Mood Graphs & Visual Insights

Daydream visualizes your emotional journey:

- 📈 **Mood Over Time** – Line chart showing daily highs/lows
- 🎨 **Emotion Distribution** – Pie or bar chart for emotion categories
- ⏳ **Change Over Time** – Trends in tone, energy, clarity, etc.
- 🌗 **Moon-Like Cycles** – Weekly “emotional weather” forecasts

### 6. Adaptive Personalization

Daydream learns your writing style and emotional cues over time.  
Reflections and stories become increasingly personalized — they sound like they’re written just for you.
