# ✨ What I’m Building

**Daydream** is a story journal app where users casually write what’s going on in their life — anything from  
_“I have to go to LA”_, _“I want to build a startup”_, to _“I don’t want to study anymore, but I have to.”_

---

# 📝 How It Works

### 1. Raw Expression

Users type freely in their own voice — unfiltered, chaotic, honest.  
It’s not about grammar or coherence. It’s about what’s on your mind.

### 2. One-Click Journal Summary

With one click, Daydream generates a journal-style summary. Users can choose the tone:

- ✍️ **Reflective**
- 🎭 **Poetic**
- 🧠 **Minimal**
- 😂 **Humorous**
- 💬 **Conversational**

### 3. Story Mode (Every 5–10 Days)

Daydream transforms scattered entries into a cohesive, readable life narrative.  
This isn’t just logging events — it’s reliving your story, chapter by chapter.

### 4. Emotion Analysis

Each entry is analyzed using AI for:

- **Core emotions** (joy, sadness, anxiety, hope, etc.)
- **Mood intensity**
- **Emotional trends over time**

These insights feed into the summaries and stories.  
If your week was anxious but ended on a hopeful note, the tone reflects that naturally.

### 5. Mood Graphs & Visual Insights

Daydream visualizes your emotional journey:

- 📈 **Mood Over Time** – Line chart showing daily highs/lows
- 🎨 **Emotion Distribution** – Pie or bar chart for emotion categories
- ⏳ **Change Over Time** – Trends in tone, energy, clarity, etc.
- 🌗 **Moon-Like Cycles** – Weekly “emotional weather” forecasts

### 6. Adaptive Personalization

Over time, Daydream learns your writing style and emotional vocabulary.  
Summaries and stories start to sound more like you — because they’re based on your patterns.
