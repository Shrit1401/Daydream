# One Pager For My Idea

## What I am building

I am building daydream, a story journal app where user can have basic write what's going on in their life at the point anything maybe I have to go La, I wanna build a startup, I don't wanna study anymore, but I have to study, and stuff then with one click it generates a simple summary is a journal way (or we can have options), and then once with 10-5 days user can go to story mode and read their journal in a story way

we're gonna first take the user input on how user writes, and we're gonna store it
